# Topological Detection of Heart Dseases.
An attempt to classify Cardio Time Series.

See PDF for the full report.

Overview: This project is an attempt to classify a time series using topological embeddings. We use Taken Delay Embedding followed by calculation of persistent homology. Next, the classification of topological information will be made.
